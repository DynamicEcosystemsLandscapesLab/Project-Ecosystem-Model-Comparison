This file contains the single tree idealized growth patterns from SORTIE_ND, There are the orignal CSV's as well as
subdivided csv's containing each life stage. Note that in the orginal species csv's the values are given but do not directly
have titles other than f1,f2, etc. This is because of the orginal XML format. Species were assigned DBH, Height, Etc to these values
using the formatting code in the XML. Also included is mean_idealized_growth.csv which is the compilation of this data used for the 
growth values in the PPA model
