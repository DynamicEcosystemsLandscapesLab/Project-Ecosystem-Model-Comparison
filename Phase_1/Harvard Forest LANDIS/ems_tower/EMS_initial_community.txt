>> The forest contained 100 Mg-C ha -1 in live aboveground woody biomass (AGWB) when the HFEMS was established
>> [Barford et al., 2001]. About 1/3 of the existing red oaks were established prior to 1895, another 1/3 prior to
>> 1930, and the rest before 1940 (N. Pederson, Columbia University, private communication, 2003); hence the stand
>> is 75â€“110 years old.  
>>oaks: In 1992 when measurements start, based on above...I substracted 1992 from 1895,1930,and 1940 to get 97,62, and 52.  
>>red maple:  I assumed that red maple came in after 1938 hurricane (1992-1938==54).
